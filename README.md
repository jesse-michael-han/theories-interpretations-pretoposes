# Theories, interpretations, and pretoposes

At some point, while writing my master's thesis, I realized I would have been better off just deleting Chapter 1 entirely and rewriting it from scratch.

I ended up doing just that, with this document as the result (although only _after_ submitting the thesis...)

There's nothing essentially new here; the most interesting part is a precise statement and detailed proof of the 2-equivalence between the 2-category of Boolean coherent categories with coherent functors and the 2-category of first-order theories with equality-preserving interpretations. It is, of course, an induction on complexity of formulas, but with nontrivial additional bookkeeping.
